Modeling questions

do we want to have groups for each set of unique judges in a district. That could be done by just concatenating their names together?

We want to look at a couple of things

-   how long it takes for cases to get resolved over time
-   how filing behavior changes as judges get added
-   how different groups of appointees--most importantly grouped appointing president change flows into different courts
    -   do they change the mix of lawsuits brought to each court (interaction with nature of suit?)
    -   do they change the pace of filings
    -   do they change which kinds of parties are filing
