Trying to get a data-set of which judges are in each district court on each day.

Each judge has his own page with a structured paragraph. Detailing service.

we need:

-   appointments (sometimes more than one)

    -   date of start, date of senior status, date of termination

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   president (can vary by appointment)

-   court (can vary by appointment)

```{r}

# base url with pages for each letter:
url <- "https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/search/glossary-search/"

letters <- letters
urls <- paste0(url, letters)

get_judges <- function(letter_url){
  
  rvest::read_html(letter_url) |> 
    rvest::html_element(
      css = "body > div.l-page > div > div > div > div.view-content") |> 
    rvest::html_elements("a") |> 
    rvest::html_attrs() -> judge_stems
  
  paste0("https://www.fjc.gov", judge_stems)
}

judges <- purrr::map(urls, get_judges) |>  purrr::list_c()

get_text <- function(url){ 
  url |> 
    rvest::read_html() |> 
    rvest::html_element(css = "body > div.l-page > div > div > div > div") |> 
    rvest::html_text2()
  }

#this takes a bit.
