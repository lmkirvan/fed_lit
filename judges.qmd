Trying to get a dataset of which judges are in each district court on each day.

Each judge has his own page with a structured paragraph. Detailing service.

```{r}

# base url with pages for each letter:
url <- "https://www.fjc.gov/history/judges/search/glossary-search/"

letters <- letters
urls <- paste0(url, letters)

result <- rvest::read_html(urls[[1]])

body <- result |> 
  rvest::html_text2()

nodes <- rvest::html_element(
  result
  , css = "body > div.l-page > div > div > div > div.view-content")

nodes |> 
  rvest::html_elements("a") |> 
  rvest::html_attrs() -> judges_urls

judges_urls <- paste0("fjc.gov", judges_urls)


```
